# Professional Portfolio
My personal software development portfolio. This page showcases my progress throught the bootcamp. 

Update Feb 28: Page uses advanced CSS styling, Flexbox and Media Queries to adapt its layout to any screen size. 

## Acceptance Criteria 
- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
- WHEN I load their portfolio
- THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
- THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
- THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
